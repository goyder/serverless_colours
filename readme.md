# colours

This is a `Serverless` stack loosely based around reading colours of images.

## True intent 

The real intent of this project was to explore a number of topics related to Serverless, namely:

* Python project structure in Serverless
    * And in particular - unit testing
* Environment management (which turned out to be surprisingly straight forward)
* DynamoDB integration
* Local stack deployment

## Further reading for myself
